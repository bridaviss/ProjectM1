### Project Description
We are exploring LinkedIn job posting descriptions and analyzing what are key
qualitative factors that differentiate postings with a higher quantity of applications from a
lower quantity. We hypothesize that job postings that have a higher number of applicants
will be more detailed in summary and more descriptive in adjectives. We will be using
three different methods of keyword extraction as our text analysis.

### What you will find in this repo:
1. A section containg our source code and how to use and install it: SRC. Within it, you will find three different rmd files that performs three different methods of analysis. Each file contains code for cleaning 
the same data. The methods are as follows:
- RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction): looks for keywords by looking to a sequence of words and excludes irrelevant words. 
- Phrases: extracts common phrases of the text.
- Textrank: Textrank is an algorithm within the textrank R package. The algorithm lets us to summarize text data while extracting keywords.


2. A section containing our source data: DATA.

3. A section containing key figures from our analysis: FIGURES.

4. A reference section containing all acknolwedgments and references.

### [Installing/Building Our Code](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings):
- You can download the data set here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings 
- We are using the job_postings.csv 


### [Usuage of Our Code](https://github.com/bridaviss/ProjectM1/tree/main/SRC):
1. The goal of this analysis was to provide the audience with key qualitative factors that may differientiate Linkedin job postings that had a higher quantity of applications from a lower quantity of applications.
   - To do this, we performed three analyses:
       1. Phrases Extraction
